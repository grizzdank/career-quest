# Career Quest Game Implementation Guide

This document outlines how to implement and customize the Career Quest game for your portfolio website.

```

## Sprite Implementation

The game is currently configured to use colored rectangles as placeholders instead of actual sprite images. When you're ready to add real sprites:

1. Create the `assets/sprites/` directory structure
2. Add your sprite images with these exact filenames:
   - `player.png` - Your character
   - `jiraMonster.png` - JIRA ticket enemy
   - `zombieManager.png` - Manager enemy
   - `meeting.png` - Meeting enemy
   - `arrow.png` - Projectile

3. In `career-quest.js`, find the `loadSprites()` method and uncomment the image loading code:
   ```javascript
   async loadSprites() {
     const spriteNames = ['player', 'jiraMonster', 'zombieManager', 'meeting', 'arrow'];
     const loadPromises = spriteNames.map(name => {
       return new Promise((resolve) => {
         // Comment out or remove this placeholder code:
         // this.sprites[name] = { width: 32, height: 48, placeholder: true };
         // resolve();
         
         // Uncomment this code:
         const img = new Image();
         img.onload = () => {
           this.sprites[name] = img;
           resolve();
         };
         img.onerror = () => {
           // Fallback to placeholder on error
           this.sprites[name] = { width: 32, height: 48, placeholder: true };
           resolve();
         };
         img.src = `assets/sprites/${name}.png`;
       });
     });
     
     await Promise.all(loadPromises);
   }
   ```

4. The game will automatically use your sprite images instead of the colored rectangles.

## Artwork Creation

For authentic retro game vibes, create pixel art sprites for:

1. Player character: Represent yourself in professional attire
2. Enemies:
   - JIRA Ticket Monsters: Ticket-shaped creatures
   - Middle Manager Zombies: Slow-moving bureaucratic figures
   - Meetings: Circular clock-like enemies that multiply
3. Projectiles: Code snippet arrows, presentation slides, etc.
4. Background elements: Office environment, tech company buildings

You can create these using:
- Piskel (https://www.piskelapp.com/) - Free online sprite editor
- Aseprite - Professional pixel art tool ($20)
- Or commission a pixel artist on Fiverr/Upwork

## Coding Challenges

Create real-world relevant coding challenges for your field:

1. Simple function implementations
2. Algorithm puzzles
3. Debugging exercises
4. Design pattern implementations

The game evaluates the code by checking for keywords and structure, so keep challenges simple but relevant to your skills.

## Customization Ideas

Make the game truly represent your career and skills:

1. **Portfolio Integration**: Make discovered items in the game unlock real portfolio pieces
2. **Skill Tree**: Create a skill tree representing your actual skills
3. **Different Levels**: Each level could represent different companies/roles you've worked at
4. **Easter Eggs**: Hide elements from your hobbies or interests
5. **Personalized Dialogue**: Add conversations with "NPCs" representing colleagues or mentors

## Technical Improvements

To enhance the prototype:

1. Add a proper sprite system with animation frames
2. Implement collision detection with proper hitboxes
3. Create a level design system using tilemaps
4. Add sound effects and background music
5. Implement a save system to remember progress
6. Create a proper code editor for coding challenges

## Deployment

1. Host the game files alongside your portfolio website
2. Ensure the game is responsive for different screen sizes
3. Add loading optimization for mobile users
4. Include controls for touch devices

## Performance Considerations

- Use sprite sheets to reduce HTTP requests
- Implement object pooling for projectiles and effects
- Consider canvas scaling for high-DPI displays
- Add a lower-quality mode for mobile devices

## Analytics Integration

Consider adding simple analytics to see:
- How many visitors play the game
- Which levels they reach
- How long they engage with your portfolio after playing
- Which coding challenges they attempt/complete

This data can help you refine the experience and understand what engages potential employers.
